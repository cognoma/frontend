<li><strong>Warranty Disclaimers</strong>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, (A) WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES RELATED TO THE CCDL, OR ANY SERVICES, DATA OR OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE THEREON OR ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; AND (B) THE CCDL IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY RELATED TO ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, QUALITY OR THAT THE CCDL WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.</p>

<p>APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIABILITIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU AGREE THAT BECAUSE SUCH WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND US (AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US), OUR AND OUR LICENSORS’ AND SUPPLIERS’ LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
